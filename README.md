Hola a todos, I'm Eloisa and I'm a data scientist that loves math, python & statistics. Thank you for viewing my portfolio. 

I've been working on these programs in a daily basis for my personal reference and for my readers. I hope you will enjoy them as much I did when working on them. My favorites ones so far are 32 & 33
..for my amusement, practice and better comprehension
