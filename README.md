Hola a todos, 

I'm Eloisa, I'm a Data Scientist and I’m passionate about using data science, programming, and statistical analysis to solve Big Data challenges and deliver valuable business insights. 

I would love to join a company with big data science projects and challenges.

Please check out my Github portfolio for the data science projects I'm working on:

In addition I would love to mention that I'm a co-organizer of the PyLadies Seattle and I’m also organizing the PyData Seattle conferences for July 5 -7 2017 at Microsoft. 

PyData Seattle is going to have a diversity panel and I would love to invite you or anybody in your team that would like to apply and participate in our diversity panel. Panelists will represent a diverse array of experience and areas of practice in Tech. Panelist will offer suggestions and strategies for Gender Diversity in Tech.
