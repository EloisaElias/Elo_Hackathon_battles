I'm Eloisa a Data Scientist. I’m passionate about using data science, programming, and statistical analysis to solve Big Data challenges and deliver valuable business insights. 

I’m an active member of the Seattle Tech community. I'm a co-organizer of PyLadies Seattle, supporting over 1155 local members. PyLadies is a worldwide group of women developers in Python programming language with presence in Seattle-Bellevue. In addition, I also co-organize the PyData Seattle conferences, which brings together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. PyData is an international conference series drawing thousands of participants each year worldwide.

I would love to join a company with big data science projects and challenges. Check out my Github portfolio for the data science projects I'm working on:
